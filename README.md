# keylogger
This project is a simple keylogger developed in Python using the pynput library. A keylogger is a tool designed to capture and log every keystroke made on a computer. This project aims to provide an educational example of how keystroke logging works, illustrating the capabilities of Python in capturing and recording user input.

Key Features:
1. Keystroke Logging: Captures all keystrokes and logs them to a file (keylog.txt).
2. Simple and Lightweight: The script is straightforward and easy to understand, making it ideal for educational purposes.
Customizable: The logging file location and format can be easily customized as needed.
